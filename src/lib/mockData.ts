    question: "How does Kaptik achieve high translation quality?",
    answer:
      "We use a K-pop glossary built from fandom vocabulary and slang commonly used by young Koreans. This improves word accuracy significantly. When members speak in English, we detect and keep the English as-is. We also use member voice data for speaker identification, so you always know who's saying what.",
